    My name is Rachel Busanic, and I’m currently learning the art of animation and want to pursue voice acting.
    For as long as I can remember I’ve always found myself fascinated by how each animation has its own style of projecting either the characters or the background movements. Whether it’s 2D or 3D animation I’ll find myself fascinated by it, like how smooth it can be in some scenes, or even how rough or fast paced it can get in action packed films.</p>
    <p>Favorites of styles of animation is 2D, and stop motion.
    What really inspired me to get into animation had been many things. Most of them had been music, movies, and cartoons I watched since I was a child; particularly the ones that stood out were the ones that were the most unique, in other words the ones that were more out of this world.</p>
    <p> Movies, music and cartoons that stand out most out of the crowd are what really inspire me to take up the style of animation.</p>
    <p>When it comes to voice acting, I like how the people behind the voices of the characters they don’t just say a line or two and be done with it; they instead become the character themselves, in a way they transform into them. It’s like watching the Joker being played by Mark Hamill or the late Robin Williams playing the Genie in Aladdin. In a sense to me at least, the people behind the voices bring the characters to life in their own unique way.
